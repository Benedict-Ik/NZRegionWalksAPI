Here is what we did in this branch:

- Added a new `WalksController` class.
- Created a new `CreateWalkDTO` model class in the DTO folder.
- Created a new repository class and interface called `SQLWalkRepository` and `IWalkRepository` respectively.
- Finally, created a new endpoint called `CreateWalk` in the `WalksController` class.

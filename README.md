Here is what we did in this branch:

    - Chnage the return type from `WalkDTO` to `CreateWalkDTO`,
    - Implemented the `GetWalksByID` method in the `WalksController` class.
    - Also implemented the methods to `UpdateWalkAsync ` and 'DeleteWalkAsync`.
    - Made use of anonymous objects when sending response to the API in the return body.
